I am a final-year B.Tech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), passionate about leveraging AI technologies to create impactful solutions. My interest spans across Large Language Models (LLMs), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and deep learning, with experience in implementing end-to-end ML pipelines from data preprocessing to deployment using frameworks like PyTorch.
Recently Worked On:

Interpreted models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost using SHAP on a heart attack dataset, analyzing how each feature contributes to the overall prediction.
Currently working on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, with a focus on building and improving a GUI-based RAG research paper Q&A system.

My academic journey and projects reflect a strong inclination toward innovation and problem-solving. Whether it's building scalable AI systems, exploring retrieval-augmented techniques, or optimizing models for deployment, I thrive on challenges that combine theory with practical application.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I enjoy creative writing, poetry, and playing the piano. I find intellectual stimulation in games like chess and sudoku and enjoy listening to podcasts that inspire new ideas and perspectives.
